# A Simple Tic-Tac-Toe Game 🎲

Hey there! 👋 This is a simple little Tic-Tac-Toe game I made with Python. You can play right in your terminal against a bot that picks its moves randomly. It's nothing fancy, just a fun project to get the hang of game logic.

### So, what can it do? 🤔

* **Play against the computer** 🤖: See if you can beat the bot! (Its quite dumb)
* **Pick your side** 🙋: You can choose to play as 'X' or 'O'. (Remember, 'X' always goes first).
* **Clean and simple** ✨: The board is easy to read and updates right after every turn.
* **Knows when it's over** 🏁: The game will tell you if you've won, lost, or if it's a draw.
* **No silly mistakes** 👍: If you try to pick a spot that's already taken or enter something weird, it'll just pick for u

### Wanna Play? 🎮

Getting it running is super easy.

1.  First, make sure you have **Python** on your computer. 🐍
2.  Save the code as a Python file (like `tictactoe.py`). 💾
3.  Open up your terminal, go to the folder where you saved the file, and just type: ⌨️
    ```bash
    python tictactoe.py
    ```
4.  That's it! Just follow the instructions on the screen. 🎉

Hope you enjoy it!
